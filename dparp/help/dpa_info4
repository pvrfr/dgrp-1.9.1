The  "Examine Received / Transmit Data" displays allow for the browsing of
data captured in the "Monitor Port Traffic" mode.   The data from only one
direction  may  be  browsed  at  a time.  A highlighted cursor tracks your
position in the buffer.

The total amount captured and your current byte position within the buffer
are displayed in the window heading.


Keystrokes for browsing the data:

   LEFT/RIGHT   (also h/l) Decrease/Increase your byte position by one. In
                this way, you can scan the entire buffer simply by holding
                down the right arrow.

   UP/DOWN      (also k/j) Decrease/Increase your byte position by a line.

   P/N          Decrease/Increase your byte position by whole pages.

   T            Switch to the transmit buffer if viewing the receive one.

   R            Switch to the receive buffer if viewing the transmit one.


The  "C"  key  will  bring  you  to the "Capture" window in order to clear
the capture buffer and begin capturing new data, whereas the escape or "Q"
will  return  you  to  the channel display.


The Redraw (^L) option causes the tool to redisplay the entire screen,
particularly useful with "dirty" connections in which the display becomes
corrupt.

The Print Screen (^P) option invokes a screen dump  to  the  default  file
/tmp/dpalog.   If  another  file and/or path is desired, simply invoke the
tool with the -l option.

        e.g.       dparp -l <logfile>
