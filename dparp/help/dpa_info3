The  "Monitor Port Traffic" display allows for the near real-time
monitoring of modem signals and data for a port.


NOTE: Whenever  you  return to the "Capturing" screen,  the capture buffer
      is cleared.  This includes when temporarily leaving  the  screen  to
      examine this help file or taking a screen capture.

NOTE: The most recent data is always to the left and above the highlighted
      "cursor" (__).


Since  the  space available to display the data is limited,  a few methods
for changing the allocated space on the fly via keystrokes are allowed:

   +  Grow the size of the "Rx Data" window when both are displayed

   -  Shrink the size of the "Rx Data" window when both are displayed

   R  Display the "Rx Data" window only

   T  Display the "Tx Data" window only

   B  Display both Rx and Tx


The  "E"  key  will  bring  you to the "Examine" window in order to browse
the captured data,  whereas the escape or  "Q"  will  return  you  to  the
channel display.


The Redraw (^L) option causes the tool to redisplay the entire screen,
particularly useful with "dirty" connections in which the display becomes
corrupt.

The Print Screen (^P) option invokes a screen dump  to  the  default  file
/tmp/dpalog.   If  another  file and/or path is desired, simply invoke the
tool with the -l option.

        e.g.       dparp -l <logfile>
