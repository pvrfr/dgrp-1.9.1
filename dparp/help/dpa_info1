The fields on the main screen have the following meanings:


Device ID:   The Device's ID in the Operating System.

IP Address:  The remote device's IP address.

Ports:       The number of ports on the Device.

Status:      The current state of the device in the OS.
             Possible values are:

        Down          Indicates the device at the configured IP
                      address is either not responding, or has
                      rejected the connection.

        Available     Indicates that status information about
                      the specific Device is available.


To get more information about one of the displayed ports, use the up 
an down arrow keys to move the highlighted bar to the desired device,
then press <Enter>.


A general note about navigation within the tool:


  NOTE:   If the arrow keys do not map correctly, the tool will 
          display the following message:

                        Invalid Key.

  If this occurs, substitute the standard UNIX cursor movement keys for the
  up and down arrows:  Down = J or j;  Up = K or k;  
                       Left = H or h;  Right = L or l.


The Redraw (^L) option causes the tool to redisplay the entire screen,
particularly useful with "dirty" connections in which the display becomes
corrupt.

The Print Screen (^P) option invokes a screen dump  to  the  default  file
/tmp/dpalog.   If  another  file and/or path is desired, simply invoke the
tool with the -l option.

        e.g.       dparp -l <logfile>
