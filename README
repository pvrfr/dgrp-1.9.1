	INSTALLATION NOTES FOR THE RPM SRC PACKAGE

WARNING:  do not attempt to install this package if there is already a 
RealPort (dgrp) driver loaded, or daemons running.

for the truly impatient
-----------------------
Execute the following commands:
	1> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.src.rpm	(prepare for installation)
	2> cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	3> rpm -bi dgrp-1.9.spec 			(perform make and install)

for the slightly less impatient
-------------------------------
The above commands make and install a working RealPort (dgrp) driver.
However, rpm does not recognize this as an installed package yet.  In order to use the 
full capabilities of the rpm utilities, one needs to go a step further 
and create an rpm binaries package for their specific architecture, and then
install this package on their machine.
To do this, use instead the following set of commands:

	1> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.src.rpm	(prepare for installation)
	2> cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	3> rpm -bb --target=<arch> dgrp-1.9.spec 		
			(perform make and install AND make binary rpm)
	4> cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>
	5> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.<arch>.rpm		(install the package)

<arch> is the architecture of the installation machine (ie i386, i686,
alpha, etc).

NOTE: Older versions of rpm use --buildarch <arch> instead of --target=<arch>.

for the rest of us
------------------
Ignore the above and read on...
Most of the rpm commands allow for -v or -vv to turn on verbose and
double verbose output.

about the package
-----------------
The file dgrp-1.9-36.src.rpm is the Linux RealPort (dgrp) source code rpm
package, to be built on any architecture.  You must have the rpm 
(Red Hat Package Manager) facility installed on your machine. 

first things first
------------------
	1> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.src.rpm
The fist command installs the source code in the SOURCES directory used by 
RPM (/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES).  The actual source code is distributed as a 
zipped tar file.  This command also copies the spec file to the SPEC directory.
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dgrp-1.9.spec is just a text file with some 
script like commands, package information and file list.  

installing using the defaults
-----------------------------
You are now ready to build the RealPort (dgrp) driver package.  If you want to
just use the default settings, the build is simple and can be performed
by issuing the commands:

	2> cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	3> rpm -bb --target=<arch> dgrp-1.9.spec 		
			(perform make and install AND make binary rpm)

This will attempt to create an rpm binaries package.
If the build completes without error, you will see the message 
"Wrote:  /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/dgrp-1.9-36.<arch>.rpm"

	4> cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>
	5> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.<arch>.rpm		(install the package)

To check if all the files were installed correctly, use

	6> rpm -bl [-vv] dgrp-1.9.spec

You now have your very own copy of the RealPort (dgrp) Linux package
compiled for your specific architecture and kernel version!  It can
be found in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>/dgrp-1.9-36.<arch>.rpm 
Next time you do an installation on a machine with the same 
configuration you need just do 
	
	> rpm -ivv dgrp-1.9-36.<arch>.rpm


custom installation
-------------------
If you need to customize the Makefiles to reflect your own configuration, 
or modify the source code, this will need to be done prior the build.
To access the Makefile, you have to first unpack the tgz file:

	2> cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
	3> rpm -bp dgrp-1.9.spec

The "-bp" in the options specifies that only the prep section of the spec file
should be executed.  This will, among other things, create the 
/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/dgrp-1.9 directory and unpack the tarfile
there.  

	4> cd ../BUILD/dgrp-1.9

You may then make any necessary changes to the Makefile and source code.

WARNING:  you might want to now save the final version of your changes 
somewhere other than in the /usr/src/redhat tree for backup.

WARNING:  if you change the final location that any of the files in the 
package, you will also want to update the %file list in the spec file
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/dgrp-1.9.spec  Otherwise, RPM will complain 
that the installation was incomplete, because some files were not found.
You can also document your changes in the %description section, if you
so desire.

There are several ways to install the driver package at this point, but the
following is the easiest, and safest way:

	5> cd /usr/src/redhat/BUILD 
	6> tar -cvzf ../SOURCES/dgrp-1.9.tgz dgrp-1.9/*
	(this will replace the original source code provided by the package)

You can now execute commands 2 through 6 from the section "installing using
the defaults" to install your customized rpm.

verifying the package
---------------------
You can check if the RealPort (dgrp) package is installed using the verfify (-V)
command line option:
	> rpm -V -vv dgrp

removing RealPort (dgrp) Linux
-----------------------
If you have built the rpm binaries package as indicated, then you can
use rpm to remove it.  Simply use the erase (-e) command line option:
	> rpm -e -vv dgrp
