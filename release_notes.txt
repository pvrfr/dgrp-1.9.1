  1. INTRODUCTION    

     Digi RealPort Linux is a driver package for Digi's Ethernet-based
     Serial Products.
     
     It is assumed that TCP/IP is running on the system and is properly
     configured.
     
     It is also useful, though not necessary, for the Wish package to
     be installed, or some other TCL interpreter, in order to use the
     RealPort Manager configuration tool.
     
     It is currently supported on the following hardware platforms:
     
     o Standard i386/i486 and Pentium PC (x86 32bit)
     o x86 64bit
     
     and is currently supported on the following Linux distributions:
     
     o Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x
     o Red Hat Linux 7.2, 7.3, 8, 9
     o Fedora Core 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 18
     o Mandriva Linux 8.2, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 10.0, 10.1, 2006, 2007.1, 2008
     o SuSE 8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2, 11.1, 11.2
     o Debian 3.0.r1, 3.1, 4, 6
     o Ubuntu 7.04, 7.10, 8.04, 8.10, 12.04, 18.04
     
     NOTE: Because of the rapid rate of releases from each respective
           Vendor, the tested/supported list above quickly becomes
           out of date.
           
           This driver package has been tested and verified working for
           kernels up to and including version 2.4.37, 2.6.38, and on
           various 3.X kernels (3.0.0, 3.0.58 and 3.8.0, 3,9.0, 3.10.0,
           3.11.0, 3.12.0, 3.13.0 and 3.14-rc4) from kernel.org.
           
           It is anticipated that this driver will work with Vendor kernel
           releases newer than the above but cannot be guaranteed because
           each respective Vendor can, and does, add their own various
           changes/patches to the stock kernel.org kernel.
           
           These additional Vendor patches to the stock kernel.org linux
           kernel can cause unforeseen incompatibilities with this driver.

     International web site (www.digi.com) or ftp site (ftp.digi.com)

  3. ENHANCEMENTS
     o None

  4. BUG FIXES
     o Fix an installation problem on systems such as RHEL 7 where
       /etc/sysconfig/network exists but does not define a NETWORKING
       environment variable.

     o Fix a driver build problem on newer kernels, which removed
       definitions for TTY_CLOSING (in v3.11) and TTY_HW_COOK_IN (in v3.19).
       Note that Red Hat backported at least some of these definition
       removals into RHEL 7 kernels starting sometime shortly after
       3.10.0-229, so this driver fix is also needed for their newer
       3.10 kernels.

     o Add a description of the rtstoggle option to the ditty man page.

     o Fix a timing vulerability where an application that fast cycles
       many port open/closes could occasionally obstruct a close from
       completing properly, thus leading to a "locked" port.

     o Fix a problem that could cause the dpa.dgrp utility program to
       crash with an arithmetic exception if it happened to catch a port
       during the early stages of an uncompleted open.
      

  5. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

     o To build the dgrp driver you must have first loaded the matching
       kernel source tree for your target kernel.

     o To verify that you have matching kernel source, run "/bin/uname -r"
       and check to make sure the /usr/src directory has the corresponding
       linux-<version> directory.

     o If you are running a prebuilt kernel from a packaged distribution,
       this typically involves loading the kernel sources from your
       distribution CD to your system, then using the following commands
       to do the following:

       1. cd /usr/src/linux-<your_version_of_the_kernel>
       2. make mrproper           Clean up any old version files.
       3. make oldconfig          Make a configuration file to match
                                  your running kernel.
       4. make dep                Create the dependency and version files.

       Now you can load and build the dgrp driver package.


     o Occasionally, a Linux Vendor will ship a kernel that simply cannot
       be autodetected to add the various changes that might be required
       for that specific kernel.  Because of this, there is an option that
       can be used for both the srpm and tgz to tell the driver package
       exactly what distribution you have.

       Currently, the only needed and recognized option is for
            Red Hat AS/ES/WS 3 and Fedora
       The flags are:
            REDHAT_AS_3 / REDHAT_ES_3 / REDHAT_WS_3
            FEDORA

       Examples:

       To tell the srpm that you have Red Hat AS 3, run this instead:

            o rpmbuild --rebuild --define DISTRO=REDHAT_AS_3 40002086_X6P.src.rpm

       To tell the tgz that you have Red Hat AS 3, run this during the  
       "configure" phase:

            o ./configure DISTRO=REDHAT_AS_3


     o To install this package correctly under SuSE 8.0, a symlink
       from /usr/lib/libncurses.so.2.1 to /usr/lib/libncurses.so needs to
       be created.  Simply run this command:
            ln -s /usr/lib/libncurses.so.2.1 /usr/lib/libncurses.so
       then start the installation of the Realport package.

     o There is a known incompatibility/issues with the 2.6.26 kernel.
       Because of these incompatibility/issues, the 2.6.26 kernel is not
       supported with this driver.

     o There is a known incompatibility between our driver and the
       Red Hat 7.1 distribution which ships a custom modified 2.4 kernel.
       The problem manifests itself with device driver usage counts which
       never decrease, possible loss of use of some numbers of ports,
       and possible system instability.  The root cause is in the
       modification of the kernel, which makes a change to an internal
       interface and introduces an incompatibility.

     o There is a problem with the SBRK ioctl.  When a BRK is 
       sent no more data is transmitted until the port is closed.

     o The ports on EM modules are observed to perform at a slightly
       reduced speed during throughput testing.

     o The ditty PRINTER option is not yet supported.

     o If this RealPort driver package detects that the system's OpenSSL
       layer is too old to be used reliably, the driver will compile its
       own more current version of OpenSSL.  This compile could take a
       considerable amount of time, anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes extra.
       The extra time it takes depends upon how fast of system the driver
       is being compiled on.


  6.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

     o This driver is distributed both as a source RPM and as a compressed
       tar file of the source.

     o If you install the source RPM version of the source, it is usually
       as easy as running the following:

           1. rpmbuild --rebuild 40002086_X6P.src.rpm
           2. rpm -i dgrp-1.9-36.i386.rpm

     o If you install the compresed tar version of the source, it is usually
       as easy as running the following:

           1. tar xvfz 40002086_X6P.tgz
           2. cd ./dgrp-1.9
           3. ./configure
           4. make all
           5. make install
           6. make postinstall

     o This package includes several support utilites:

           o ditty                 - an stty replacement.
           o dinc                  - a cu/tip replacement.

     o There is a package of configuration tools provided that are,
       by default, located in the /usr/bin/dgrp/config directory.
       There are scripts for using the command line to add and remove
       products, as well as the RealPort Manager.  
       This is essentially a graphical front end for the scripts and a
       visual tool for monitoring individual serial ports.

    o The software package includes two startup scripts in either the
      /etc/rc.d/init.d or /etc/init.d directories named "dgrp_daemon" and
      "dgrp_ditty".
      These scripts will be executed at startup automatically if the
      "chkconfig" tool is present on the system during the post installation
      phase of the driver install.  Otherwise, these scripts must be manually
      added to the system startup.

    o To load and initialize the driver by hand, execute "dgrp_daemon start".
      To stop the driver daemons and unload the driver, execute
      "dgrp_daemon stop" followed by "rmmod dgrp".


    o The following manpages are provided:
          ditty-rp(1), 
          drpd(8), 
          dgrp(8),
          dgrp_cfg_node(8), 
          dgrp_gui(8). 

    o Red Hat 7.1 -- Kernel Compatibility Issues
         Some 2.4 kernel-based distributions (Red Hat 7.1 included)
         have a patch applied to them which modifies the behavior of
         Linux when an open of a serial port is canceled (for instance,
         if an application is waiting for the carrier signal and a user
         hits CTRL-C to kill the application)

         With this behavior change, the device driver is unable to
         cleanup its internal data structures and the sane functioning
         of the driver is compromised.  The classic symptom of this
         problem is that the command "lsmod", which (among other things)
         will return a count of the applications using the device driver,
         will return a non-zero value even if all applications associated
         with the serial ports are killed.

         Unfortunately, it is impossible (from within the device driver)
         to determine which behavior is implemented in the running kernel.
         However, Digi now provides a workaround to allow customers with
         this problem to change the Digi behavior to be compatible with
         these "patched" kernels.

        To enable the change which provides alternate behavior when a
        serial "open" call fails, execute the following after the device
        driver is loaded:

            echo "alt_fail_open=1" > /proc/dgrp/info

        To return to the standard behavior, execute:

            echo "alt_fail_open=0" > /proc/dgrp/info

        To examine the current state of this driver tuning variable:

            cat /proc/dgrp/info

       Unfortunately, this command must be executed each time the device
       driver is loaded (i.e. when the system is booted).  To make this
       process easier for customers, the Digi standard driver startup
       tools will execute the command on the customer's behalf when it
       loads the driver if the following command is executed:

           touch /usr/bin/dgrp/config/alt_fail_open

       This command will create a file in your file system.  The Digi
       tools, if they detect the existence of this file, will enable the
       "alt_fail_open" behavior on your behalf at every system boot.
   


  7. HISTORY
    o Version 1.9.1-35
      	  o Ported to the 4.X.X kernel.
	  o Cleaned up compile messages for the user space programs.
    o Version 1.9-35
          o Previously there was a time window at the beginning of port
            opens during which "dgrp_cfg_node" could mistakenly conclude
            that the corresponding node was idle.  If "dgrp_cfg_node uninit"
            were called during this window it could crash the kernel.  A new
            detection mechanism has been added to cover these conditions.

    o Version 1.9-34
          o Fix driver build problem on systems (such as RHEL 7) that define
            CONFIG_UIDGID_STRICT_TYPE_CHECKS.

    o Version 1.9-33
          o Added support for the now latest 3.X kernels (from 3.9.0 through
            3.14).

          o Use /tmp/dgrp (rather than /tmp) during installation to avoid
            the unintended side-effect of modifying the permissions on /tmp.

          o Fix an initialization problem where first opens of transparent
            print devices (/dev/pr*) could crash 3.7.0 and newer kernels.

    o Version 1.9-32
         Interim test release

    o Version 1.9-31
         o Added support for 3.X kernels through 3.8.

         o Changed the dgrp udev rules:
              a. Use SYMLINK rather than NAME since the latter causes
                 problems on newer systems.

              b. Add TAG="systemd" so dgrp devices will be recognized
                 on systemd-based distributions (e.g: to start getty's).

         o Updated configure scripts to add support for newer
           distributions.

    o Version 1.9-30
          o Added support for kernels up to 2.6.38

    o Version 1.9-20

          Fix a problem with the RealPort UDEV script when using
          new versions of UDEV.

          Fix problem on network disconnect/reconnects where
          the port would always bring up DTR/RTS, even in 
          cases where the port had both signals down before
          the network disconnect.

    o Version 1.9-6

          Added support for DPA for RealPort.
          The utility is installed as /usr/bin/dpa.dgrp

          Added support for SYSFS in the 2.6 kernels.

          Fixed problem with installing from the tar.gz image.
          Fixed problem with major() and minor() symbols not being found
             on very early versions of the 2.4 kernels.
          Fixed problem on setting the following "o flag" settings:
             nl<0/1> cr<0/1/2/3> tab<0/1/2/3> bs<0/1> vt<0/1> ff<0/1>

          Added fix to resolve possible false "RealPort protocol error"
             detection.
          Fixed bug on port close.  Port might not have gotten drained

          Added support for Red Hat 9, Suse 8.2, Mandriva Linux 9.1.
          Added support in ditty for the "startin" and "startout" options.
          dgipserv - Added support to set unassigned Ethernet address,
              support for setting the tftp server IP address, support for
              setting virtual ports and virtual ports timeouts, and support
              for setting optimize to throughput or latency.
          Fixed "configure" script problem where modversion.h wasn't being
              found in the proper location.
          Fixed include file problem where the driver would not compile
              correctly under some newer versions of the 2.4 kernel.
          Fixed problem with an incorrect assert message being generated.

    o Version 1.5-0:

          Added Transparent print support. Please read the man page for
             "dgrp", under section "Transparent Print" for more information.
          Changed package install to run a "configure" script first
             before trying to compile the driver. The script should catch
             most of the problems that the compile might have beforehand,
             and give a much better description of the problem than a
             cryptic compiler error message.
          Added Support for Red hat 7.3, Suse 8, Mandriva Linux 8.2,
             and Caldera OpenLinux 3.1.1 (server and workstation).
          Fixed off-by-one error in the tbuf parsing.  This bug, although
             very rare, could have caused the kernel to panic, or cause 
             random kernel memory corruption.

    o Version 1.4-0:

          Improved support for Red Hat 7.1 by offering an architecture to
             workaround a problematic kernel patch shipped with that
             distribution.
          Added support for EL-8, EL-16 and EL-32.
          Added the "dgelreset" application, which allows one to reset
             an EtherLite regardless of whether it is running RealPort
             compatible firmware, and without having to specify a
             MAC address.
          Added "MODULE LICENSE" information to the device driver, in
             order to comply with anti-tainting policies in
             newer 2.4 Linux kernels.
          Modified driver to prevent port "hangup" in the event that the
             daemon dies.
          Added TCFLSH handling to "ditty-rp"... previously, the
          "flushin", "flushout", and "flush" options didn't work.
    o Version 1.3-0: 

          Added full support for Digi's EtherLite products which are
             running Digi RealPort compatible firmware, including the 
             EtherLite 2, EtherLite 160, EtherLite 162,
             and the EtherLite 80.
          Fixed a kernel panic if a port is open, `dgrp_daemon stop` is
             executed, and a program then goes to write to the still
             open port.
             Now write returns EIO in that condition.
          Fixed a select(2) problem in kernel 2.2.15 and later
             of 2.2.x kernels which could cause programs like telnet or
             ssh to appear to hang until a key is pressed.
          Fixed a data loss problem which would manifest itself when exactly
             four kilobytes of data were transmitted after a port was
             opened.
          Added /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/char to the list of
             locations that the kit will test for existence when trying to
             find an appropriate location to install the driver module, in
             response to testing in native 2.4 kernel-based distributions.

    o Version 1.2-2: 

          Increased support for Digi's ethernet-based serial connectivity
             family; including Digi One, EtherLite, and PortServer products.
          Added support for arbitrary integer baud rates via the "ditty-rp"
             utility.
          Detailed information about the type and version of configured
            remote devices was made available via the "/proc/dgrp/nodeinfo"
            file.
          A memory corruption problem which would cause sysem instability
             was eliminated.
          Unexpected pauses and loss in port traffic as a result of a network
             buffer overflow were resolved.

    o Version 1.1-7: 

          Added 2.4 kernel support.
          Removed references to invalid email addresses.
          Driver now handles Red Hat 7.0 (kgcc vs. gcc).
          The GUI tool now displays the DCD signal when viewing ports.
          RealPort ports now match other Linux serial ports for default
             settings, as well as making all port settings "sticky".  As
             a result of this change, CLOCAL is now on by default.
          Configuration scripts remove the "/dev" files if a
             PortServer is unconfigured.
          Only physical line drops are detected as a "hangup" condition...
             the driver would previously treat a change from CLOCAL to -CLOCAL
             as a carrier transition.
          Startup scripts are installed in "/etc/init.d" if
             "/etc/rc.d/init.d" does not exist.
          RPM installation will not "error out" if "chkconfig"
             (a Red Hat tool) does not exist on the system.
          A message was added to the RPM installation to communicate
             to users whether the installation scripts were added or not.
          On newer systems, RPM would inadvertently strip the driver module
             of its symbols, causing it to fail.  The module is no longer
             stripped.

    o Version 1.0-0: 

          Added a new proc file: /proc/dgrp/info.  This file allows one to
             determine the value of a number of state variables associated
             with the driver, including the driver revision.
          Continued refinement of the GUI.  The GUI is now distributed
             as a single file, rather than a collection of tcl files.
          dgrp_cfg_node now does validity checking of its ID and COUNT
             parameters.

    o  Version 0.1-7:

        A first pass at cleaning up the code was completed for beta release.
        All driver build warnings have been fixed.  Appropriate part numbers
            have been correctly placed in the appropriate documents.
        A useful driver revision number is now placed in the console log
            when the module is loaded.

    o Version 0.1-5:

       A minimum break time of 250ms is now enforced.
       A PPP hang problem was resolved.
       Continued enhancements of the packaging.

    o Version 0.1-4:

       Decided to install dgrp.o to the /usr/bin/dgrp directory, and then
       link in the postinstall phase to a suitable /lib/modules/*/misc
       directory.  This avoids the problem of having the path to dgrp.o
       hardcoded in the spec file.

    o Version 0.1-3:

       Added new scripts to autoload the driver on system startup and
       initialize any PortServers configured in /etc/dgrp.backing.store

    o Version 0.1-1:

       Pilot release in January 1999
